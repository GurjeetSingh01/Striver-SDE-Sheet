Time Complexity: We are creating a 2D array of size (numRows * numCols) (where 1 <= numCols <= numRows), and we are traversing through each of the cells to update it with its correct value, so Time Complexity = O(numRows2).

Space Complexity: Since we are creating a 2D array, space complexity = O(numRows2).
